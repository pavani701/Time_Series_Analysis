# Time Series Analysis using Python

# Project Title:
# *Analysis and predction of Microsoft_Stock.csv file which contains stocks and credits of IT firm.Prediction the value of stock in future by three category in (Open),(High),(Low).*

# Probelm Statement:
The dataset comprehensively analyzes Microsoft Corporation's stock performance from 1986 to 2023. It includes parameters like stock price, high and low prices, and trading volume. This dataset tracks Microsoft's market journey from its inception to its current global tech giant status. It aids in observing stock fluctuations, trends, and historical milestones. The stock price data illustrates valuation changes over time, while trading volume reveals investor activity levels. With decades of data, users can identify trends, cycles, and industry dynamics. The dataset is valuable for research, investment analysis, and understanding market behavior. It's important to use alongside other financial data for informed decisions, and it's updated until 2023.

# Abstarct
# A Time Series is a set of observations that are collected after regular intervals of time. If plotted, the Time series would always have one of its axes as time. Time Series Analysis in Python considers data collected over time might have some structure; hence it analyses Time Series data to extract its valuable characteristics.

 # **Trend:**
 ### The Trend shows the variation of data with time or the frequency of data. Using a Trend, you can see how your data increases or decreases over time. The data can increase, decrease, or remain stable. Over time, population, stock market fluctuations, and production in a company are all examples of trends.

# **Seasonality:**
### Seasonality is used to find the variations which occur at regular intervals of time. Examples are festivals, conventions, seasons, etc. These variations usually happen around the same time period and affect the data in specific ways which you can predict.

# **Irregularity:**
### Fluctuations in the time series data do not correspond to the trend or seasonality. These variations in your time series are purely random and usually caused by unforeseeable circumstances, such as a sudden decrease in population because of a natural calamity.

# **Cyclic:**
### Oscillations in time series which last for more than a year are called cyclic. They may or may not be periodic.

# **Stationary:**
### A time series that has the same statistical properties over time is stationary. The properties remain the same anywhere in the series. Your data needs to be stationary to perform time-series analysis on it. A stationary series has a constant mean, variance, and covariance.

# Conclusion:

1.  According to time series analysis of the data for this particluar dataset  we found that "Open","High","Low","Close" are the columns in which are trades in increasing manner but in the year 2020-2021 the stocks are goes in decreasing manner.
2.  According to the volume chart for particular yhis dataset 2016-2017 gives the littlebit of more profit to investments in the stocks.
3. After 2017 to upcoming year stocks will be pluctuated.
